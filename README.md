# Reliable AI Network (RAIN)

Agentic AI systems that **ship real outcomes**. We design and deliver multiâ€‘agent applications with guardrails, evaluation, clean data pathways, and a usable UI â€” fast.

---

## What we build

**Agent graphs** tuned to your workflows â€” not just chat. Typical builds include:

- **Orchestrated agents:** Router Â· Researcher Â· Synthesizer (+ Critic/Planner) with deterministic handoffs and bounded autonomy.  
- **Retrieval & data:** Clean ingest, indexing, and grounding with measurable relevance (golden sets).  
- **Guardrails & evals:** Safety budgets, policy prompts, redâ€‘team probes, and regression jobs tied to your golden questions.  
- **UI & traces:** Chat with stepâ€‘byâ€‘step traces, replay, exportable reports, and a runs dashboard.  
- **Deploy & runbook:** Staging â†’ production with CI and a clear ownerâ€™s manual. Ownership transfers on payment.

> Everything ships with **traces**, **cost controls**, and a **runbook** so your team can operate with confidence.

## Delivery options

- **Pilot Sprint (3â€“4 weeks):** 3â€“5 agents, 2â€“3 tools, 1 curated dataset, UI with traces, golden tests, quick guardrails.  
- **Production v1 (8â€“12 weeks):** 5â€“8 agents, 3â€“5 tools, 2â€“3 data sources, robust guardrails, eval harness, dashboards, staging+prod deploy, team training.  
- **Advisory Retainer:** Async Q&A, design reviews, risk/compliance audits, unblockers.

**Accelerated option:** For focused scopes, we offer a **â‰¤5â€‘week delivery** with a simple milestone plan (see Estimator).

## Estimate your project (5â€‘week plan)

Use the onâ€‘site **Estimator** to model scope, hours, and total price based on a few inputs:

- Agents â€¢ Integrations/Tools â€¢ Data Sources  
- ETL complexity â€¢ Safety & compliance â€¢ Deployment model â€¢ UX depth

**Pricing model:** We estimate conventional engineering hours, apply scope multipliers, then compute **AIâ€‘accelerated effort at Â¼ time**, rounding up to whole hours. Payment is **20% upfront**, then **20% weekly** for four weeks (5 equal payments).

## How we work

1. **Discovery (days, not weeks):** Scope target workflows, golden questions, data entry points, and changeâ€‘management risks.  
2. **Blueprint:** Agent graph, tools, data pathways, guardrail & eval plan, weekly milestones.  
3. **Build & prove:** Friday demos, burn report, prioritized backlog; we ship traces and tests first.  
4. **Deploy:** Staging â†’ production with CI; handover training + runbook.  
5. **Support:** 1â€‘year consultation & maintenance included with production builds.

**Weekly proof:** Each milestone ends with acceptance criteria and a short demo. No black boxes.

---

## Trust, security & compliance

- **Data handling:** Minimize surface area, redact where possible, and keep golden sets small but representative.  
- **Safety:** Policy prompts, cost/safety budgets, and gated capabilities for sensitive actions.  
- **Auditability:** Full runâ€‘level traces, inputs/outputs logging, and regression jobs for critical queries.

If you have specific requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2 boundaries, onâ€‘prem), weâ€™ll align the deployment model accordingly.

---

## Tech we like (and why)

Weâ€™re stackâ€‘agnostic, but we value **traceability**, **evals**, and **operability** over hype. Typical choices include modern LLM APIs, pragmatic vector/RAG setups, lightweight orchestration, and simple UIs your team can own. Weâ€™ll meet you in your cloud.
